        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
          literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
          College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
          and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
          Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
          Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
          Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
          1.10.32.</p>
        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in
          some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going
          to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of
          text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making
          this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a
          handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem
          Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
